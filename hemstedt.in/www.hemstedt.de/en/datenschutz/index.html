</p><p>Insofar as we decide either alone or jointly with others on the purposes and means of data processing, this includes above all the obligation to inform you transparently about the nature, scope, purpose, duration and legal basis of the processing (cf. Articles 13 and 14 DS-GVO). With this statement (hereinafter: "Privacy Notice"), we inform you about the manner in which your personal data is processed by us.
</p><p>Our data protection notices have a modular structure. They consist of a general part for any processing of personal data and processing situations that come into play each time a website is called up (A. General) and a special part, the content of which relates in each case only to the processing situation specified there with the designation of the respective offer or product, in particular the visit to websites detailed here (B. Visit to websites, C. Video conferences, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D. Mail inquiries and E. Business partner).

</p><p>the following definitions:
</p><p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Personal data" (Art. 4 No. 1 GDPR) means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ("data subject"). A person is identifiable if he or she can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, an online identifier, location data or by means of information relating to his or her physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity characteristics. The identifiability can also be given by means of a linkage of such information or other additional knowledge. The origin, form or embodiment of the information is irrelevant (photographs, video or audio recordings may also contain personal data).
</p><p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Processing" (Art. 4 No. 2 GDPR) means any operation which involves the handling of personal data, whether or not by automated, i.e. technology-based, means. This includes, in particular, the collection, i.e. the acquisition, recording, organization, arrangement, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment, combination, restriction, erasure or destruction of personal data, as well as the change of a purpose or intended use on which a data processing was originally based.
</p><p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Controller" (Art. 4 No. 7 DS-GVO) means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.
</p><p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Third party" (Art. 4 No. 10 GDPR) means any natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body other than the data subject, the controller, the processor and the persons who are authorized to process the personal data under the direct responsibility of the controller or processor; this also includes other group-affiliated legal entities.
</p><p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Processor" (Art. 4 No. 8 DS-GVO) is a natural or legal person, authority, institution or other body that processes personal data on behalf of the controller, in particular in accordance with the controller's instructions (e.g. IT service provider). In particular, a processor is not a third party in the sense of data protection law.
</p><p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Consent" (Art. 4 No. 11 GDPR) of the data subject means any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of his or her wishes in the form of a statement or other unambiguous affirmative act by which the data subject signifies his or her agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.
</p><h4>&nbsp;(2)&nbsp; Name and address of the controller</h4><p>The controller of your personal data within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 7 DS-GVO is us:
</p><p>Hemstedt GmbH, Schleicherweg 19, 74336 Brackenheim, Germany.
</p><p>Telephone number 0 71 35/98 98-0
</p><p>office@hemstedt.de
</p><p>For further information about our company, please refer to the imprint details on our website <a href="../../../external.html?link=http://www.hemstedt.de/" target="_blank">www.hemstedt.de</a>.
</p><h4>(3)&nbsp; Contact details for data protection issues</h4><p>For all questions and as a contact person on the subject of data protection at our company, our data protection officer is at your disposal. His contact details are:
</p><p>Klaus Blükle Rechtsanwalt k.bluekle@hentschke-bluekle.de
</p><h4>(4)&nbsp;Legal bases of data processing</h4><p>By law, in principle, any processing of personal data is prohibited and only permitted if the data processing falls under one of the following justifications:
</p><p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. a DS-GVO ("consent"): If the data subject has voluntarily, in an informed manner and unambiguously indicated by a statement or other unambiguous affirmative action that he or she consents to the processing of personal data relating to him or her for one or more specific purposes;
</p><p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. b DS-GVO: If the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken at the request of the data subject;
</p><p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. c DS-GVO: If processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject, e.g. a legal obligation to preserve records;
</p><p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. d DS-GVO: If the processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person;
</p><p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. e DS-GVO: Where processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, or
</p><p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. f DS-GVO ("Legitimate Interests"): If the processing is necessary to protect legitimate (in particular legal or economic) interests of the controller or a third party, unless the conflicting interests or rights of the data subject prevail (especially if the data subject is a minor).
</p><p>For the processing operations carried out by us, we indicate below the applicable legal basis in each case. A processing operation may also be based on several legal bases.
</p><h4>(5)&nbsp;Data deletion and storage duration</h4><p>For the processing operations carried out by us, we indicate below in each case how long the data will be stored by us and when it will be deleted or blocked. Unless an explicit storage period is specified below, your personal data will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose or legal basis for the storage no longer applies. In principle, your data will only be stored on our servers in Germany, subject to any transfer that may take place in accordance with the regulations in the respective activities).
</p><p>However, storage may take place beyond the specified time in the event of a (threatened) legal dispute with you or other legal proceedings or if storage is provided for by legal regulations to which we are subject as the responsible party, e.g. § 257 HGB, § 147 AO. If the storage period prescribed by the statutory provisions expires, the personal data will be blocked or deleted unless further storage by us is necessary and there is a legal basis for this.
</p><h4>(6) Data security</h4><p>We use appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your data against accidental or intentional manipulation, partial or complete loss, destruction or against unauthorized access by third parties, e.g. TSL encryption for our website, taking into account the state of the art, implementation costs and the nature, scope, context and purpose of the processing, as well as the existing risks of a data breach (including its probability and impact) for the data subject. Our security measures are continuously improved in line with technological developments.
</p><p>We will be happy to provide you with more information on request.
</p><h4>(7)&nbsp;Cooperation with processors</h4><p>As with any larger company, we also use external domestic and foreign service providers (e.g. for IT, logistics, telecommunications, sales and marketing) to handle our business transactions. These service providers only act on our instructions and are contractually obligated to comply with the data protection provisions pursuant to Art. 28 DS-GVO.
</p><p>If personal data from you is passed on by us to our subsidiaries or is passed on to us by our subsidiaries, e.g. for advertising purposes, this is done on the basis of existing order processing relationships.&nbsp;
</p><h4>(8) Requirements for the transfer of personal data to third countries</h4><p>In the course of our business relationships, your personal data may be transferred or disclosed to third party companies. These may also be located outside the European Economic Area (EEA), i.e. in third countries. Such processing takes place exclusively for the fulfillment of contractual and business obligations and to maintain your business relationship with us. We will inform you about the respective details of the transfer in the following at the relevant points.
</p><p>Some third countries are certified by the European Commission as having a level of data protection comparable to the EEA standard through so-called adequacy decisions (a list of these countries and a copy of the adequacy decisions can be obtained here: <a href="../../../external.html?link=http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.html)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.html)</a>. However, in other third countries to which personal data may be transferred, there may not be a consistently high level of data protection due to a lack of legal provisions. If this is the case, we ensure that data protection is adequately guaranteed. This is possible through binding company regulations, standard contractual clauses of the European Commission for the protection of personal data, certificates or recognized codes of conduct.
</p><h4>(9)&nbsp;No automated decision making (including profiling)</h4><p>We do not intend to use any personal data collected from you for any automated decision making process (including profiling).&nbsp;
</p><h4>(10) No obligation to provide personal data</h4><p>We do not make the conclusion of contracts with us dependent on you providing us with personal data in advance. As a customer, you are under no legal or contractual obligation to provide us with your personal data; however, we may only be able to provide certain services to a limited extent or not at all if you do not provide the necessary data. If this should exceptionally be the case in the context of the products we offer presented below, you will be informed of this separately.
</p><h4>(11)&nbsp;Legal obligation to transmit certain data</h4><p>We may be subject to a specific legal or statutory obligation to provide the lawfully processed personal data to third parties, in particular public bodies (Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. c DS-GVO).
</p><h4>(12) Your rights</h4><p>You can assert your rights as a data subject regarding your processed personal data at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided at the beginning). As a data subject, you have the right:
</p><p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in accordance with Art. 15 DS-GVO to request information about your data processed by us. In particular, you can request information about the processing purposes, the category of data, the categories of recipients to whom your data has been or will be disclosed, the planned storage period, the existence of a right to rectification, erasure, restriction of processing or objection, the existence of a right of complaint, the origin of your data if it was not collected by us, as well as the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, and, if applicable, meaningful information about its details;
</p><p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in accordance with Art. 16 DS-GVO to demand the correction of incorrect or the completion of your data stored by us without delay;
</p><p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pursuant to Art. 17 DS-GVO to request the deletion of your data stored by us, unless the processing is necessary for the exercise of the right to freedom of expression and information, for compliance with a legal obligation, for reasons of public interest or for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims;
</p><p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to request the restriction of the processing of your data in accordance with Art. 18 DS-GVO, insofar as the accuracy of the data is disputed by you or the processing is unlawful;

</p><p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;object to the processing pursuant to Art. 21 DS-GVO, provided that the processing is based on Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. e or lit. f DS-GVO. This is particularly the case if the processing is not necessary for the performance of a contract with you. Unless it is an objection to direct marketing, when exercising such an objection, we ask you to explain the reasons why we should not process your data as we have done. In the event of your justified objection, we will review the merits of the case and either discontinue or adapt the data processing or show you our compelling legitimate grounds on the basis of which we will continue the processing;
</p><p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in accordance with Art. 7 (3) DS-GVO to revoke your consent given once (also before the applicability of the DS-GVO, i.e. before 25.5.2018 - i.e. your voluntary will made understandable in an informed manner and unambiguously by means of a declaration or other unambiguous confirming act that you agree to the processing of the personal data in question for one or more specific purposes - at any time vis-à-vis us, if you have given such consent. This has the consequence that we may no longer continue the data processing, which was based on this consent, for the future and

Cookies cannot execute programs or transfer viruses to your computer and therefore cannot cause any damage. They serve to make the Internet offer as a whole more user-friendly and effective, i.e. more pleasant for you.

</p><h3>Videoconference</h3><p>We would like to inform you below about the processing of personal data in connection with the use of "Zoom"
</p><h4>Purpose of processing</h4><p>We use the "Zoom" tool to conduct conference calls, online meetings, video conferences and/or webinars (hereinafter: "Online Meetings"). "Zoom" is a service of Zoom Video Communications, Inc. which is based in the USA.
</p><p><b>Note:</b> Insofar as you call up the Internet page of "Zoom", the provider of "Zoom" is responsible for data processing. However, calling up the Internet page is only necessary to use "Zoom" in order to download the software for using "Zoom".
</p><p>You can also use "Zoom" if you enter the respective meeting ID and, if applicable, further access data for the meeting directly in the "Zoom" app.
</p><p>If you do not want to or cannot use the "Zoom" app, the basic functions can also be used via a browser version, which you can also find on the "Zoom" website.
</p><h4>What data is processed?</h4><p>Various types of data are processed when using "Zoom". The scope of the data also depends on the data you provide before or during participation in an "online meeting".
</p><h4>The following personal data are subject to processing:</h4><p>User details: first name, last name, phone (optional), email address, password (if "single sign-on" is not used), profile picture (optional), department (optional).
</p><p>Meeting metadata: Topic, description (optional), attendee IP addresses, device/hardware information.
</p><p>For recordings (optional): MP4 file of all video, audio and presentation recordings, M4A file of all audio recordings, text file of online meeting chat.
</p><p>When dialing in with the telephone:&nbsp;Information on the incoming and outgoing call number, country name, start and end time. If necessary, further connection data such as the IP address of the device can be stored.
</p><p>Text, audio and video data:&nbsp;You may have the opportunity to use the chat, question or survey functions in an "online meeting". To this extent, the text entries you make are processed in order to display them in the "online meeting" and, if necessary, to log them. In order to enable the display of video and the playback of audio, the data from the microphone of your terminal device and from any video camera of the terminal device will be processed accordingly for the duration of the meeting. You can turn off or mute the camera or microphone yourself at any time via the "Zoom" applications.
</p><p>To participate in an "online meeting" or to enter the "meeting room", you must at least provide information about your name.
</p><h4>Scope of processing</h4><p>We use "Zoom" to conduct "online meetings". If we want to record "online meetings", we will transparently inform you in advance and - if necessary - ask for consent. The fact of the recording will also be displayed to you in the "Zoom" app.
</p><p>If it is necessary for the purposes of logging the results of an online meeting, we will log the chat content. However, this will generally not be the case.
</p><p>In the case of webinars, we may also process questions asked by webinar participants for purposes of recording and following up on webinars.
</p><p>If you are registered as a user at "Zoom", then reports of "online meetings" (meeting metadata, telephone dial-in data, questions and answers in webinars, survey function in webinars) may be stored at "Zoom" for up to one month.
</p><h4>Legal basis for data processing</h4><p>Insofar as personal data of employees is processed by us, § 26 BDSG is the legal basis for data processing. If, in connection with the use of "Zoom", personal data is not required for the establishment, implementation or termination of the employment relationship, but is nevertheless an elementary component in the use of "Zoom", Article 6 (1) f) DSGVO is the legal basis for data processing. In these cases, our interest is in the effective implementation of "online meetings".
</p><p>For the rest, the legal basis for data processing when conducting "online meetings" is Art. 6 (1) lit. b) DSGVO, insofar as the meetings are conducted in the context of contractual relationships.
</p><p>Should no contractual relationship exist, the legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) DSGVO. Here, too, our interest is in the effective implementation of "online meetings".&nbsp;
</p><h4>Recipients / passing on of data</h4><p>Personal data processed in connection with participation in "online meetings" is generally not passed on to third parties unless it is specifically intended to be passed on. Please note that the content of "online meetings", as well as personal meetings, is often used to communicate information with customers, interested parties or third parties and is therefore intended to be passed on.
</p><p>Other recipients: The provider of "Zoom" necessarily receives knowledge of the above-mentioned data, insofar as this is provided for by ZOOM within the framework of our order processing agreement.
</p><h4>Data processing outside the European Union</h4><p>"Zoom" is a service provided by a provider from the USA. Processing of personal data thus also takes place in a third country. We have concluded a processing agreement with the provider of "Zoom" that complies with the requirements of Art. 26 DSGVO.
</p><p>An adequate level of data protection is guaranteed on the one hand by the conclusion of the so-called EU standard contractual clauses. As a supplementary protective measure, we have also configured our Zoom so that only data centers in the EU, the EEA or secure third countries such as Canada or Japan are used to conduct "online meetings".
</p><h3>Business partner</h3><p>We process customer/supplier personal data such as company name, legal form, business address, legal representatives and contact persons (surname, first name, e-mail addresses and telephone/fax numbers) as well as invoice data.
